# Rpg game
An rpg game created in java. Create different heroes with different abilities. Equip armor and weapons to the characters to make them stronger and give them more damage.
Start by choosing between four hero classes. Mage, Ranger, Rogue and Warrior. Every time you level up, the powers of these heroes will level up. You can equip armor but only if the armor matches with the hero or you will get an exception. The same goes with weapons. You can only equip a weapon if it has the same level as you and if it goes with the hero.
